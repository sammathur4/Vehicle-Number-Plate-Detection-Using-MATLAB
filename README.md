# Vehicle-Number-Plate-Detection-Using-MATLAB
To detect a vehicle’s number plate from the images stored in a database. That is, it aims at detecting the license plate of a vehicle and then extracting the information regarding that vehicle using MATLAB software


The purpose of motor vehicle registration by a government authority is to establish a link between the vehicle and its owner or user. The registration number is generally alphanumeric and it uniquely identifies the vehicle within the issuing authority’s database. These number plates can be of different colours, fonts, and sizes depending upon the country and their rules.

**This project can be used in the following areas:**

* Analysis of city traffic during peak hours
* Automation of weigh-in-motion systems
* Enhanced vehicle theft prevention
* Effective enforcement of traffic rules
* Flexible and automatic vehicle entry and exit from a car parking area
* Car parking management system
* Improved security for the car parking operators

_Output_

Further, this project can be used for vehicle license plate detection at interstate borders, airports, and harbours. 
The elements considered in this project include the following:

**Number plate detection**. Both front and back number plates of a vehicle are considered for detection.

**Text extraction from the detected number plate.** It can extract the text of only one vehicle number plate at a time.

_No random images (cat, dog, etc) have been used for training purposes while designing the system._
